<title>SOUND WAVES – SS2 PHYSICS NOTE</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Meaning of Sound </h1>
<p> Sound is a form of energy produced by vibrating bodies. Anything that vibrates (e.g. tuning fork, drum, vocal cords, speakers) can produce sound.
When an object vibrates, it causes the surrounding air particles to vibrate, creating a wave that travels to the ear. </p>
<h2> Nature of Sound Waves </h2>
<p> Sound waves are: <br>
a. Longitudinal Waves: <br>
Particles of the medium vibrate back and forth in the same direction as the wave travels. </p>
<p> They form: <br>
1. Compressions – particles close together <br>
2. Rarefactions – particles spread out </p>


<p> b. Mechanical Waves: <br>
They require a material medium (solid, liquid, or gas).
Sound cannot travel through a vacuum. </p>

<h3> Production and Propagation of Sound </h3>
<p>Sound is produced when an object vibrates. These vibrations cause the medium’s particles to oscillate, passing energy from one point to another. <br>
Propagation depends on the medium: <br>
1.Fastest in solids <br>
2.Slower in liquids <br>
3.Slowest in gases <br> </p>

<p>Reason: Particle arrangement and closeness. </p>



<h4> Characteristics of Sound Waves <h4>
<p> 1. Pitch: <br>
Depends on the frequency of the sound wave.<br>
# High frequency → high pitch <br>

# Low frequency → low pitch <br>
Example: A whistle has a higher pitch than a drum. </p>


<p> 2. Loudness: <br>
Depends on amplitude of vibration. <br>

#Larger amplitude → louder sound

#Smaller amplitude → softer sound </p>


<p> 3. Quality (Timbre) <br>

Enables us to distinguish between sounds of the same pitch and loudness from different sources (e.g., piano vs guitar).



<h5> Speed of Sound </h5>
<p> Speed of sound varies with medium, temperature, and humidity. <br>

# Approximate values: <br>
Air (20°C): 343 m/s <br>
Water: 1500 m/s <br>
Iron: 5000 m/s</p>


<p>Formula:<br>
v = \frac{d}{t}<br>

Where:<br>
v = speed<br>
d = distance<br>
t = time<br>

<h6> Reflection of Sound</h6>

<p>Sound can bounce off surfaces just like light. This produces:<br>

a. Echo:<br>

A sound heard after reflection from a distant surface.</p>

<p>Conditions for echo:<br>

# Reflecting surface at least 17 m away (since sound needs 0.1 s to be heard separately)

Hard, smooth surface<br>


b. Reverberation:<br>

Repeated reflections making sound prolonged or echoey, common in halls and churches.<br>

<p>To reduce reverberation:<br>

a. Use curtains<br>

b. Carpets<br>

c. Sound-absorbing materials</p>


<h7>Applications of Sound</h7>

<p> 1. Ultrasound in medicine (scanning, imaging)<br>

2. SONAR for detecting underwater objects<br>

3. Echo sounding for measuring sea depth<br>

4. Communication<br>

5. Musical instruments</p>

<h8> Noise vs Musical Sound</h8>

<p>Noise	Musical Sound<br>

Unpleasant, irregular vibration	Pleasant, regular vibration
Example: Traffic noise	Example: Piano, violin</p>


<h9> Human Hearing Range</h9>

<piHumans: 20 Hz – 20,000 Hz (20 kHz)<br>

# Below 20 Hz → Infrasound<br>

# Above 20 kHz → Ultrasound</p>

<h10> Differences Between Sound Waves and Light Waves</h10>

<p>Sound/Light<br>

1. Mechanical/Electromagnetic <br>
2. Longitudinal/Transverse <br>
3. Needs medium/Can travel in vacuum <br>
4. Slower/Very fast (3×10⁸ m/s) <br>
